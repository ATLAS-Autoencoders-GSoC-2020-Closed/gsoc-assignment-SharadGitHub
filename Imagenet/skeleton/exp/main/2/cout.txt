In PyTorch 1.1.0 and later, you should call them in the opposite order: `optimizer.step()` before `lr_scheduler.step()`.  Failure to do this will result in PyTorch skipping the first value of the learning rate schedule.See more details at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate
